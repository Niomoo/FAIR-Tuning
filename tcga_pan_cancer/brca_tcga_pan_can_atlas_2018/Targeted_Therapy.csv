Target,Therapy,Type,Description
HER2,Monoclonal antibodies;Antibody-drug conjugates;Kinase inhibitors,protein,"The side effects of HER2 targeted drugs are often mild, but some can be serious. Discuss what you can expect with your doctor. If you are pregnant, you should not take these drugs. They can harm and even cause death to the fetus. If you could become pregnant, talk to your doctor about using effective birth control while taking these drugs.

Monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates can sometimes cause heart damage during or after treatment. This can lead to congestive heart failure. For most (but not all) women, this effect lasts a short time and gets better when the drug is stopped. The risk of heart problems is higher when these drugs are given with certain chemo drugs that also can cause heart damage, such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and epirubicin (Ellence). Other factors that can increase your risk of heart problems are being older than 50, being overweight or obese, having heart problems, and taking medicines for high blood pressure.

Because these drugs can cause heart damage, doctors often check your heart function (with an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan) before treatment, and regularly while you are taking the drug. Let your doctor know if you develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, leg swelling, and severe fatigue.

Lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib, and the combination of pertuzumab with trastuzumab can cause severe diarrhea, so it¡¯s very important to let your health care team know about any changes in bowel habits as soon as they happen.

Lapatinib and tucatinib can also cause hand-foot syndrome, in which the hands and feet become sore and red, and may blister and peel.

Lapatinib, neratinib, and tucatinib can cause liver problems. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your liver function during treatment. Let your health care team know right away if you have possible signs or symptoms of liver problems, such as itchy skin, yellowing of the skin or the white parts of your eyes, dark urine, or pain in the right upper belly area.

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) can cause serious lung disease in some women. In some cases this might even be life threatening. It¡¯s very important to let your doctor or nurse know right away if you¡¯re having symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or fever.  "
CDK4/6,Palbociclib£¨Ibrance£©;ribociclib£¨Kisqali£©;abemaciclib£¨Verzenio),protein,
mTOR,Everolimus (Afinitor) ,protein,"Common side effects of everolimus include mouth sores, rash, diarrhea, nausea, feeling weak or tired, low blood counts, shortness of breath, and cough. Everolimus can also increase blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and blood sugars, so your doctor will check your blood work regularly while you are taking this drug. It can also increase your risk of serious infections, so your doctor will watch you closely for infection."
PI3K,Alpelisib (Piqray),protein,"Side effects can include a rash, high blood sugar levels, signs of kidney, liver, or pancreatic problems, diarrhea, rash, low blood counts, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, mouth sores, weight loss, low calcium levels, blood clotting problems, and hair loss. Very severe skin reactions, such as rashes with peeling and blistering, are possible and should be reported to a doctor. Patients with a history of severe skin reactions should tell their doctor before taking alpelisib. Your cancer care team might recommend that you take an antihistamine medicine to help prevent the rash and may also check your blood sugar levels regularly."
Antibody-drug conjugate,Antibody-drug conjugate,protein,"Some common side effects of this drug include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, feeling tired, rash, loss of appetite, hair loss, low red blood cell counts, and belly pain. Serious side effects can include very low white blood cell counts (with an increased risk of infection), severe diarrhea, and infusion reactions (similar to an allergic reaction) when the drug is infused. Medicines are normally given before each treatment to lower the chances of vomiting and infusion reactions."
BRCA,Olaparib (Lynparza);talazoparib (Talzenna),gene,"Only a small portion of women with breast cancer are born with a mutated BRCA gene, which is in all the cells of the body. This is different from the gene change happening after you are born which is found only in the cancer cells. If you are not known to have a BRCA mutation, your doctor will test your blood to be sure you have one before starting treatment with these drugs.

Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, taste changes, low red blood cell counts (anemia), low platelet counts, and low white blood cell counts. Rarely, some people treated with a PARP inhibitor have developed a blood cancer, such as myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (AML)."
triple-negative breast cancer,Antibody-drug conjugate,protein,"Some common side effects of this drug include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, feeling tired, rash, loss of appetite, hair loss, low red blood cell counts, and belly pain. Serious side effects can include very low white blood cell counts (with an increased risk of infection), severe diarrhea, and infusion reactions (similar to an allergic rection) when the drug is infused. Medicines are normally given before each treatment to lower the chances of vomiting and infusion reactions."
