Target,Therapy,Type,Description
EGFR,Cetuximab,protein,"The most common side effects of cetuximab are skin problems such as an acne-like rash on the face and chest during treatment, which can sometimes lead to infections. An antibiotic cream or ointment may be prescribed to help lessen the skin rash and related infections. Developing this rash might suggest the cancer is responding to treatment.

Other side effects can include headache, tiredness, fever, and diarrhea. A rare but serious side effect of cetuximab is an allergic reaction during the first infusion, which could cause problems with breathing and low blood pressure. You will be given medicine before treatment to help prevent this."
NTRK,Larotrectinib(Vitrakvi);entrectinib(Rozlytrek),gene,"Common side effects of TRK inhibitors include muscle and joint pain, cough, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea."
HER2,Trastuzumab (Herceptin);,protein,"If trastuzumab and a taxane chemotherapy combination has been tried and is no longer working, sometimes an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) might be used. An ADC is a monoclonal antibody linked to a chemotherapy drug. In this case, the anti-HER2 antibody acts like a homing signal by attaching to the HER2 protein on cancer cells, bringing the chemo directly to them. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla or TDM-1), an ADC, has had favorable initial results in salivary gland cancers that are HER2 positive. This drug is given in a vein (IV)."
androgen receptor,"Bicalutamide (Casodex) ;leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard)",protein,"Side effects of bicalutamide and leuprolide given together can include diarrhea, feeling sick to your stomach, liver problems, and tiredness."
