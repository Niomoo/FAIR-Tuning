Target,Therapy,Type,Description
mTOR ,Temsirolimus (Torisel);Temsirolimus (Torisel),protein,"Common side effects of this drug include mouth sores, an increased risk of infections, nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, skin rash, feeling tired or weak, fluid buildup (usually in the legs), and increases in blood sugar and cholesterol levels. A less common but serious side effect is lung damage, which can cause shortness of breath or other problems."
angiogenesis,Sunitinib (Sutent),protein,"The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, changes in skin or hair color, mouth sores, weakness, and low white and red blood cell counts. Other possible effects include tiredness, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, bleeding, hand-foot syndrome, and low thyroid hormone levels."
tyrosine kinases,Sorafenib (Nexavar),kinase,"The most common side effects seen with this drug include fatigue, rash, diarrhea, increases in blood pressure, and redness, pain, swelling, or blisters on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet (hand-foot syndrome)."
tyrosine kinases,Pazopanib (Votrient),kinase,"Common side effects include high blood pressure, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, low blood cell counts, and hair color change. It can cause lab test results of liver function to become abnormal, but it rarely leads to severe liver damage that could be life threatening. Problems with bleeding, clotting, and wound healing can occur, as well. In rare cases it can also cause a problem with the heart rhythm or even a heart failure. If you are taking this drug, your doctor will monitor your heart with EKGs as well as check your blood tests for liver or other problems."
tyrosine kinases,Cabozantinib (Cabometyx),kinase,"Common side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, poor appetite and weight loss, high blood pressure, hand-foot syndrome, and constipation. Less common but more serious side effects can include serious bleeding, blood clots, very high blood pressure, severe diarrhea, and holes forming in the intestines."
forming new blood vessels,Lenvatinib (Lenvima),kinase,"Common side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, joint or muscle pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, weight loss, high blood pressure, and swelling in the arms or legs. Less common but more serious side effects can include serious bleeding, blood clots, very high blood pressure, severe diarrhea, holes forming in the intestines, and kidney, liver, or heart failure."
the growth of new blood vessels,Bevacizumab (Avastin),kinase,"More common side effects include high blood pressure, tiredness, and headaches. Less common but possibly serious side effects include bleeding, blood clots, holes forming in the intestines, heart problems, and slow wound healing."
the growth of new blood vessels,Axitinib (Inlyta),kinase,"Common side effects include high blood pressure, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, poor appetite and weight loss, voice changes, hand-foot syndrome, and constipation. High blood pressure requiring treatment is fairly common, but in a small number of patients it can get high enough to be life-threatening. It can also cause problems with bleeding, clotting, and wound healing. In some patients, lab test results of liver function can become abnormal. Axitinib may also cause the thyroid gland to become underactive, so your doctor will watch your blood levels of thyroid hormone while you are on this drug."
cancer cell growth,Tivozanib (Fotivda),kinase,"Common side effects include high blood pressure, diarrhea, nausea, poor appetite, cough, mouth sores, feeling tired, and voice changes. Less common but more serious side effects can include heart problems, life threatening high blood pressure, blood clots, bleeding, poor wound healing, abnormal thyroid tests, and damage to the kidney."
HIF-2a,Belzutifan (Welireg),protein,"Common side effects of this drug include low red blood cell counts (anemia), feeling tired and/or dizzy, nausea, headache, increased blood sugar levels, and changes in lab tests showing the drug might be affecting the kidneys. Less common but more serious side effects can include very low red blood cell counts (severe anemia), which might require blood transfusions, and low oxygen levels in the body, for which you might need oxygen therapy or even be admitted to the hospital."
